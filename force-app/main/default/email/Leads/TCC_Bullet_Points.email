        <h2>Protection &amp; Safety</h2>
        <p>The nature of concrete cutting and breaking is heavy cumbersome work. Removing concrete from a kitchen or basement has its challenges. We understand that scratching the sheetrock or denting a door can result in unhappy customers and costly repairs. We offer several different levels of protection to best service your needs and budget. You can pick and choose what works on a per project basis. For example if there are no stairs that we need to use, then we will not add stair protection to the proposal. The services are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Protection of exterior surfaces such as front steps, driveway, lawn etc.</li>
            <li>Protection of exterior door jambs and saddles</li>
            <li>Protection of interior floors</li>
            <li>Protection of interior walls</li>
            <li>Protection of interior doors</li>
